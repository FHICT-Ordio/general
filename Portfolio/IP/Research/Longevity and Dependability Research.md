## Introductions
This report will describe and document the execution of my individual free-topic research. This research will be based on my indiviual project "Ordio". More information about Ordio can be found in my individual portfolio.

This research will focus on the longevity and dependability of my in-house developed platform Ordio. Ordio is in essence a platform for other developers to build upon and offers developers a platform to use when building digital ordering applications for restaurants and food services alike. Ordio can provide menus for these applications and gives restaurant owners an application to create and import their menus easily.

<br>

Because of its nature Ordio is not a very powerfull platform on its own. What gives the platform power is external developers building their applications on top of the existing platform. However, to make this possible in the first place one aspect is very important: The difficulty of integrating Ordio into new applications. A rule of thumb: The easier Ordio is to integrate into new applications, the more the platform will be used and the longer it stays relevant and active.

<br><br>

## Methodology
This research will take a better look into difficulty of integrating the Ordio platform into new applications for external developers with the provided documentation. The main research question is as following:

> How independent is the Ordio platform 

<br>

To help answer this question I split the main research question into multiple sub questions:

1. What documentation does an external developer need to implement the Ordio platform into a new application?

2. How much time does an external developer need to learn how to use and implement the Ordio platform in their application with the given documentation?

3. How difficult is the implementation process of Ordio for external developers with the given documentation?

4. How much extra communication between in-house and external developers besides the public documentation is needed to comfortably implement Ordio into a new application?

### Research Stratagies
This research was conducting using the DOT framework (<b>D</b>evelopment <b>O</b>riented <b>T</b>riangulation). The following research stratagies will be used for each research question:

| Research Question | Research Strategy |
| --- | --- |
| <b>(1)</b> What documentation does an external developer need to implement the Ordio platform into a new application? | Library-, Showroom- and Workshop-research |
| <b>(2)</b> How much time does an external developer need to learn how to use and implement the Ordio platform in their application with the given documentation? | Workshop-research |
| <b>(3)</b> How difficult is the implementation process of Ordio for external developers with the given documentation? | Workshop- and Field-research |
| <b>(4)</b> How much extra communication between in-house and external developers besides the public documentation is needed to comfortably implement Ordio into a new application? | Workshop-research |
