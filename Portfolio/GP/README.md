# Portfolio Group Project (Eeventify)

For our group project we developed a platform called Eeventify. Eeventify is a social discovery app where users can sign up, create events, and attend event other users created. A user can select interests they would like to show up on their feed and Eeventify could generate a feed for the user based on their selected interests.

This project was made in colaboration with Finish studens from OAMK, where we (the Fontys development team) made a backend API responsbile for all handling event- and user data, and the Finish students made two frontend applications in two development teams of the API we made. More about this project can be found on the Eeventify GitHub found [here](https://github.com/Eeventify/main).

Besides the development of the platform itself, I have a few learning outcomes to adress. These will be discussed in this document.

## Eeventify Platform
The full stack web application we made for this project can be found on the Eeventify GitHub. This consists of multiple repositories all combined on one GitHub organisation. The organisation can be found [here](https://github.com/Eeventify). 

Within the Eeventiy project I was responsible for setting up the user service which was responsible for the login-functionatlies and user authorization. I worked on the following user stories:

| Story |
| --- |
| As a User I want to Login to be able to use the application |
| As a user I want to be able to Register a new account |
| As a user I want to be able to view other users profiles |
| As a user I want to be able to log in with my account |

<br>

Furthermore, I helped other with their tasks and was assigned to integrate Entity Framework on the different services. The entirety of the codebase can be found on the organistaion repositories above. The user-service repository that I mainly worked on can be found [here](https://github.com/Eeventify/user-service).

## Extreme Programming
As part of our curriculum we did research into agile methods. One of these Agile methods was Scrum, an agile method we have worked with for the past years and are experience with, but also a second agile method that we were not experienced with. I decided to do research about the Extreme Programming (XP) agile method. This was part of our joined agile research and can be found on the Eeventify GitHub. My part about XP can be found [here](https://github.com/Eeventify/main/blob/main/Documentation/Agile.md#extreme-programming-xp).

<br><br>

## Cultural differences and ethics
As part of our curriculum we looked into Cultural differences and ethics of software engineering. Two short documents detailing the process of both these documents were made. The document about Cultural differences can be found [here](./Ethics%20and%20Cultural%20differences/Cultural%20differences.md). The document about Ethics can be found [here](./Ethics%20and%20Cultural%20differences/Ethics.md).

<br><br>

## Requirements
To determine the requirements for our project we sat down together with the Fins and our stakeholders (Bert and the Finish teacher) to determine what our project should look like. The requirements were noted and made into user stories that were documented using agile scrum on our scrum board. This scrum board can be found on [Taiga](https://tree.taiga.io/project/jeffrey_derksen-international-project). This was a joint group effort

## Business processes

## Professional
Probably one of the most important parts of the group project is professionalism. This outcome entails not only professional behaviour towards stakeholders, but also largely entials the communication and teamwork within the development team itself. We set this off right from the start by setting up a teamwork-contract which described a few important key details:

- Through what platform communication would be had. We decided on WhatsApp for communication without our backend development team and Discord for communication betwee the international teams. A Discord server was set up for this.
- When and at what times group project days would be had. We decided on Mondays and Fridays, where the stand up would start at 9.30 meaning everyone should be present at this time
- What to do in case of absence. We discussed how to report absence, which would be done through the groupchat including Bert well before 9 AM. If no absence was reported and someone did not show up, they would be given a strike. Three strikes meant treating the group to pie. This never occured during the project

<br>

In my opinion the communication went very well throughout the entire project, both from my side and my team members side. Every group member pulled their weight, and we had frequent stand-ups where we discussed the state of the project and what to do next. Everyone was very well involved with the project and constant communication was maintained with our stakeholders (teachers). 

<br>

One of the goals I set for myself for this group project was working on my communication, as in past group projects this was one of my failing points. What might have also contributed to that is the fact that a lot could be done in person again this semester which was not possible last few semesters due to COVID regulations.

<br>

Finaly, to determine how everyone felt about the teamwork and communication we decided to do a peer review at the end of the project. The results of this peer review can be found in the Canvas. Furthermore, an overview the last peer review is shown below:
