# Cultural Differences in software development
There are a large amount of cultural differences between different stakeholders and key-personel within development environments. Dont think just about differences like developers from different countries, but even team members from different regions or religious background can bring a big veriety of cultural interpretations and opinions to a developmen team. Nowadays, with the widespread use of internet and many tools that make remote working environments possible, its highly likely every developer will meet and have to work with developers from other cultures at some point in their carreer.

## Cultural Dimensions
To classify cultural background, in 1980 a cultural dimensions framework was developed by a Dutch management researcher "Geert Hofstede" called  *Hofstede's Cultural Dimensions Theory*. This framework mainly focusses on cultural differences based on differences in cultures acros countries. Hofstede's theory examines peoples values in the workspace acros a total of six dimensions. These are as follow:

<br>

1. Power Distance Index 
2. Individualism VS Collectivism
3. Masculinity VS Feminity
4. Uncertainty Avoidance Index
5. Long Term VS Short Term Normative Orientation
6. Indulgance VS Restraint

### Power Distance Index
The Power Distance Index (PDI) describes the inequality and acceptance of inequality of power between high- and low-valued members of a society. Think about this as the relationship between parent and child. In a society with a low PDI, children and parents tend to have the same equality meaning a child "talking back" to parents is more accepted, while in societies with a high DPI this would not be accepted. The Netherlands would be concidered to have a relatively low DPI whlie for example many African countries would fall under high DPI countries.

### Collectivism VS Individualism
Collectivism and Individualism describes how "hive-minded" or "self-centered" the people of a society tend to be. A country that has high Collectivism feeling tend to have individuals that take actions for the better good of the whole society, while countries with high Individualism tend to have individuals that take actions and focus more on the individual themselves. This behaviour is often seen as selfish by individuals from a Collectivistic culture. The Netherlands is concidered to be a very Individualistic country, while for example Japan is very Collectivistic.

### Masculinity VS Feminity
Masculinity and Feminity describe the gender role difference in a culture: How much does the culture value traditional gender role divisons of masculine and feminine individuals. A masculine society mostly values assertiveness, courage, strength, and competition, while a feminine society values cooperation, nurturing, and quality of life. The Dutch society tends to lean towards the Masculine side.

### Uncertainty Avoidance Index
The Uncertainty Avoidance Index (UAI) describes how likely members of a cultural group are to avoid uncertainty between one another. Cultures with a high UAI tend to have a lot of rules to leave litle room for interpertation making uncertainty unlikely, while cultures with a low UAI tend to be more lax and be less strict. The Netherlands is a country that hovers relatively in the middle, leaning towards a low UAI. A good example of a country with a high UAI is Germany and a lot of Asian cultures.

### Long Term VS Short Term Normative Orientation
Long Term and Short Term normative orientation describes what cultures focus more on: Short- or Long Term goals and rewards. Cultures with a Long Term normative orientation tend to value persistance and patience, while cultures with a Short Term normative orientation tend to focus on the near future and value fast and rapid success and gratification. The Netherlands float in the middle of these two.

### Indulgance VS Restraint
Indulgance and Restraint describe the level of societal impulse and desire for control. Cultures with a high level of Restraint tend to have individuals that have more impulse control and can put themselves on the background in situation where nessecairy. The Dutch culture hovers in the midle-ground between Indulgance and Restraint.

## Personal Experience with Cultural Differences
### Software Semester 3 Eeventify project Finnish Collaboration
This semester we did a proftaak group project called Eeventify. This was an international project where we worked together with a Finnish development team to create a social application used for connecting people. During the development process a lot of communication was had between the Dutch development team and the Finnish development team. This was done through online meetings. 

Clear differences but also many similarities in a lot of the dimensions of the Hofstedes framework could be recognised during the span of the project. For example, a very clear aspect that could be noticed during the development process was in the Individualism VS Collectivism dimension. Where as the Dutch culture is very focues on individuals, the collectivistic view of the Finnish development team was very noticable. The Finnish developers tended to be very giving during negotiations or talks where they were very quick to seek a compromise between our and their wants in the project.

### Project Void British Collaboration
In a hobby project in the gamedesign sector of IT, I collaborated with a small group of Dutch and British developers in a project where we made a small game. As mentioned, the development group consisted of both Dutch and Britisch software developers. Within this project group there was a noticable difference in cultures between the Dutch and British developers, mainly in the Uncertainty Avoidance dimension:

While many of the Dutch developers were quite lax regarding project requirements and Definitions of Done for these requirements, the British developers wanted to make solid and written in depth agreements about both the requirements and Definiton of Done. Eventually the Dutch developers did align with the Brits and we did set up the in depth agreements they wanted.
